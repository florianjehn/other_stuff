    "    * your explanation of your code in the presentation (40 Points)\n",
    "    * good comments and code structure (5 Points)\n",
    "    * solving the problem with pandas (5 Points)\n",

    "## Important Hint\n",
    "If you struggle with the tasks presented here, do not start banging your head against the wall. Take a step back, write down in normal english what you think your program should do. Then translate it to code. If you still struggle, take a look again at the exercises or look on the internet or books for new ones. Also, going for a walk and relaxing with something different like food or sports helps your head coming up with solution to programming problems on its own (just try it when you are stuck)."
